Task 1: 

•	First Come First Serve:

First Served (FCFS) is a type of scheduling algorithm used by operating systems and networks to efficiently and automatically execute queued tasks, processes and requests by the order of their arrival. An FCFS scheduling algorithm may also be referred to as a first-in, first-out (FIFO) algorithm or a first-come, first-choice (FCFC) algorithm.

Method:

After Writing the code of ‘FirstComeFirstServe.c’ in the Text editor and saving it we run the given commands in the Terminal.

Task 2:

•	Priority Scheduling:

Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority.
The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis.

Method:

After Writing the code of ‘Prioirty_Scheduling.c’ in the Text editor and saving it we run the given commands in the Terminal.

Task 3:

•	Priority With IO:

Priority scheduling as a non-preemptive algorithm and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems. Each process is assigned first arrival time (less arrival time process first) if two processes have same arrival time, then compare to priorities (highest process first).

Method:

After Writing the code of ‘Prioirty_with_IO.c’ in the Text editor and saving it we run the given commands in the Terminal.

Task 4:

•	Round Robin:

A round robin is an arrangement of choosing all elements in a group equally in some rational order, usually from the top to the bottom of a list and then starting again at the top of the list and so on. A simple way to think of round robin is that it is about "taking turns."

Method:

After Writing the code of ‘RoundRobin.c’ in the Text editor and saving it we run the given commands in the Terminal.

Task 5:

•	Shortest Remaining Job First:

Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is the preemptive version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm, where the processor is allocated to the job closest to completion. 

Method:

After Writing the code of ‘ShortestRemainingJobFirst.c’ in the Text editor and saving it we run the given commands in the Terminal.

Task 6:

After Writing the code of ‘SRTF_with_IO.c’ in the Text editor and saving it we run the given commands in the Terminal.

Task 7:

•	Shortest Job First:

Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution

Method:

After Writing the code of ‘SRTF_with_IO.c’ in the Text editor and saving it we run the given commands in the Terminal.
